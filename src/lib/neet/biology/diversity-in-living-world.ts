  subject: 'Biology',
  conceptNotes: `
### 1. The Living World (உயிரி உலகம்)
*   **What is living?:** Definitive characteristics include metabolism, cellular organization, and consciousness. Non-definitive characteristics include growth and reproduction.
*   **Biodiversity:** The variety of life forms on Earth.
*   **Need for classification:** To organize the vast number of species for easier study.
*   **Taxonomy & Systematics:** Taxonomy is the science of classification. Systematics includes evolutionary relationships.
*   **Concept of species and taxonomical hierarchy:** A hierarchical classification: Kingdom (பேரரசு) → Phylum (தொகுதி) → Class (வகுப்பு) → Order (வரிசை) → Family (குடும்பம்) → Genus (பேரினம்) → Species (சிற்றினம்).
*   **Binomial Nomenclature:** System of naming organisms with two components: a generic name and a specific epithet. Proposed by Carolus Linnaeus. (e.g., *Homo sapiens* - மனிதன்).

### 2. Five Kingdom Classification
*   Proposed by R.H. Whittaker. The kingdoms are Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia.
*   **Kingdom Monera:** Includes all prokaryotes.
    *   *Salient features:* Unicellular, prokaryotic, cell wall made of peptidoglycan, naked DNA.
    *   *Examples:* Bacteria (*E. coli*), Cyanobacteria (*Nostoc*).
*   **Kingdom Protista:** Unicellular eukaryotes.
    *   *Salient features:* Unicellular, eukaryotic, can be autotrophic or heterotrophic, have cilia or flagella for locomotion.
    *   *Examples:* Amoeba, Paramecium, Diatoms.
*   **Kingdom Fungi:** Heterotrophic, eukaryotic organisms.
    *   *Salient features:* Multicellular (except yeast), eukaryotic, saprophytic/parasitic, cell wall made of chitin.
    *   *Examples:* Yeast, Mushroom, *Rhizopus*.
*   **Lichens, Viruses and Viroids:**
    *   **Lichens:** Symbiotic association between algae and fungi.
    *   **Viruses:** Non-cellular, obligate intracellular parasites with a protein coat (capsid) and genetic material (DNA or RNA).
    *   **Viroids:** Infectious agents smaller than viruses, consisting of free RNA without a protein coat.

### 3. Plant Kingdom (தாவர உலகம்)
*   **Algae:** Simple, thalloid, autotrophic, and aquatic.
    *   *Salient features:* Lack true roots/stems/leaves, chlorophyll-containing, cell wall of cellulose.
    *   *Examples:* *Spirogyra*, *Chlamydomonas*.
*   **Bryophytes:** "Amphibians of the plant kingdom."
    *   *Salient features:* Live in moist areas, dependent on water for reproduction, main plant body is haploid (gametophyte).
    *   *Examples:* Mosses (*Funaria*), Liverworts (*Marchantia*).
*   **Pteridophytes:** First terrestrial plants with vascular tissues.
    *   *Salient features:* Have true roots, stem, and leaves; possess xylem and phloem; main plant body is diploid (sporophyte).
    *   *Examples:* Ferns (*Dryopteris*), Horsetails (*Equisetum*).
*   **Gymnosperms:** Plants with "naked seeds."
    *   *Salient features:* Ovules are not enclosed by an ovary wall, seeds are exposed.
    *   *Examples:* *Pinus*, *Cycas*.

### 4. Animal Kingdom (விலங்கு உலகம்)
*   **Non-chordate up to phyla level:**
    *   **Phylum Porifera:** Sponges. Cellular level of organization, water canal system. *Examples:* *Sycon*, *Spongilla*.
    *   **Phylum Coelenterata (Cnidaria):** Jellyfish, Corals. Tissue level, radial symmetry, cnidoblasts present. *Examples:* *Hydra*, *Aurelia*.
    *   **Phylum Platyhelminthes:** Flatworms. Dorso-ventrally flattened body, bilaterally symmetrical, acoelomates. *Examples:* *Taenia* (Tapeworm), *Fasciola* (Liver fluke).
    *   **Phylum Aschelminthes:** Roundworms. Organ-system level, pseudocoelomates, complete alimentary canal. *Examples:* *Ascaris*, *Wuchereria*.
    *   **Phylum Annelida:** Earthworms, Leeches. Metamerically segmented body, true coelomates. *Examples:* *Pheretima*, *Hirudinaria*.
    *   **Phylum Arthropoda:** Insects, Spiders, Crabs. Largest phylum. Jointed appendages, chitinous exoskeleton. *Examples:* *Apis* (Honey bee), *Anopheles* (Mosquito).
    *   **Phylum Mollusca:** Snails, Octopus. Second largest phylum. Soft-bodied, usually with a calcareous shell. *Examples:* *Pila*, *Octopus*.
    *   **Phylum Echinodermata:** Starfish, Sea urchins. Spiny-skinned, exclusively marine, water vascular system. *Examples:* *Asterias* (Starfish), *Echinus*.
*   **Chordate up to classes level:**
    *   **Class Cyclostomata:** Jawless vertebrates. Sucking and circular mouth. *Examples:* *Petromyzon* (Lamprey), *Myxine* (Hagfish).
    *   **Class Chondrichthyes:** Cartilaginous fishes. Ventral mouth, placoid scales. *Examples:* *Scoliodon* (Shark), *Pristis* (Sawfish).
    *   **Class Osteichthyes:** Bony fishes. Terminal mouth, cycloid/ctenoid scales, operculum present. *Examples:* *Labeo* (Rohu), *Exocoetus* (Flying fish).
    *   **Class Amphibia:** Can live on land and in water. Moist skin, two pairs of limbs. *Examples:* *Rana* (Frog), *Salamandra*.
    *   **Class Reptilia:** Crawling mode of locomotion. Body covered by dry, cornified skin (scales or scutes). *Examples:* *Chelone* (Turtle), *Naja* (Cobra).
    *   **Class Aves:** Birds. Presence of feathers and beak, forelimbs modified into wings. *Examples:* *Corvus* (Crow), *Pavo* (Peacock).
    *   **Class Mammalia:** Most unique character is the presence of mammary glands. Body covered by hair, external ears (pinnae). *Examples:* *Homo sapiens* (Man), *Panthera leo* (Lion).

        problem: 'You discover a new organism that is multicellular, heterotrophic, lacks a cell wall, and has tissues organized into organs. To which kingdom would you assign it and why?',
        solution: 'The organism would be assigned to the **Kingdom Animalia**. \n**Justification:** \n1.  **Multicellular and Eukaryotic:** This rules out Monera and Protista. \n2.  **Heterotrophic:** This rules out Plantae. \n3.  **Lacks a cell wall:** This is the key feature that distinguishes animals from plants (cellulose wall) and fungi (chitin wall). \n(பல செல், யூகேரியோட்டிக், பிறசார்பூட்ட முறை, மற்றும் செல் சுவர் இல்லாததால் இது விலங்கு உலகத்தைச் சேர்ந்தது.)'

    {
        problem: 'A student writes the scientific name for mango as *Mangifera Indica*. Identify the error in this representation according to the rules of binomial nomenclature.',
        solution: 'The error is in the capitalization of the specific epithet. According to the rules of binomial nomenclature: \n1. The generic name (*Mangifera*) should start with a capital letter. (Correct) \n2. The specific epithet (*indica*) should start with a small letter. (Incorrect in the student\'s version) \nThe correct way to write it is ***Mangifera indica***. Additionally, when handwritten, both parts should be underlined separately, or italicized when printed. (சிற்றினப் பெயர் (indica) சிறிய எழுத்தில் தொடங்க வேண்டும்.)'

    {
        problem: 'Why are bryophytes called the "amphibians of the plant kingdom"?',
        solution: 'Bryophytes are called the "amphibians of the plant kingdom" because, although they live in soil, they are dependent on **water for sexual reproduction**. Their male gametes (antherozoids) are flagellated and need water to swim to the female gamete (egg) for fertilization to occur. This dual dependence on both land (for living) and water (for reproduction) is analogous to amphibians in the animal kingdom. (பிரையோஃபைட்டுகள் நிலத்தில் வாழ்ந்தாலும், கருவுறுதலுக்கு நீரைச் சார்ந்துள்ளன. எனவே அவை தாவர உலகின் இருவாழ்விகள் எனப்படுகின்றன.)'
