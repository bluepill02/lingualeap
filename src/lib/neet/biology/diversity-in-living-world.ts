    subject: 'Biology',
    learningObjectives: [
        "Define what is living and understand the concept of biodiversity.",
        "Understand the principles of taxonomy, systematics, and binomial nomenclature.",
        "Describe the characteristics of the five kingdoms: Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia.",
        "Learn the key features and examples of major phyla in the Animal Kingdom.",
        "Learn the key features and examples of major groups in the Plant Kingdom (Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms, Angiosperms).",
        "Understand basic tools for the study of taxonomy, like herbaria and museums."

    conceptOverview: "This unit introduces the vast diversity of life on Earth. It starts with the very definition of 'living' and then delves into the principles of classification (taxonomy) and systematics. It provides an overview of the five-kingdom classification system and then explores the major characteristics of each kingdom, focusing on the key features of Monera, Protista, Fungi, and the detailed classification within the Plant and Animal Kingdoms.",
    tamilConnection: "சங்க இலக்கியங்களில், நிலத்தின் தன்மையைப் பொறுத்து (குறிஞ்சி, முல்லை, மருதம், நெய்தல், பாலை) அங்கு வாழும் உயிரினங்கள் வகைப்படுத்தப்பட்டன. இது சூழலியல் அடிப்படையிலான ஒரு பழங்கால வகைப்பாட்டியல் ஆகும். நவீன உயிரியல், பரிணாமத் தொடர்புகளின் அடிப்படையில் உயிரினங்களை வகைப்படுத்துகிறது, இது இந்த அத்தியாயத்தின் மையக் கருத்தாகும்.",
    culturalContext: "The sheer biodiversity seen in the Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage site bordering Tamil Nadu and Kerala, is a living example of the concepts discussed in this chapter. From the smallest fungi to the largest elephants, each organism fits into a specific taxonomic rank (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species), helping scientists understand their relationships and conserve this rich diversity.",

      "The concept of 'systematics' and its distinction from 'taxonomy' is often under-emphasized in the TN State Board syllabus. NCERT places a clear focus on systematics as the study of evolutionary relationships. (சிஸ்டமேட்டிக்ஸ் மற்றும் வகைப்பாட்டியலுக்கு இடையேயான வேறுபாடு TN பாடத்திட்டத்தில் குறைவாகவே வலியுறுத்தப்படுகிறது. NCERT பரிணாம உறவுகளின் ஆய்வாக சிஸ்டமேட்டிக்ஸை மையப்படுத்துகிறது).",
      "Detailed explanation of the rules of binomial nomenclature as laid down by ICBN and ICZN is more explicit in NCERT. TN board covers it, but direct questions from the rules (e.g., author citation) are more common in NEET. (இருசொற் பெயரிடுதலின் விதிகள் NCERT-ல் தெளிவாக விளக்கப்பட்டுள்ளன. NEET தேர்வில் விதிகளிலிருந்து நேரடி கேள்விகள் வரலாம்).",
