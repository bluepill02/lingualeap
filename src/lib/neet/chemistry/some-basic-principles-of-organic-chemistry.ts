    chapter: 'Some Basic Principles of Organic Chemistry',
    subject: 'Chemistry',
    learningObjectives: [
        "Understand the tetravalency of carbon and the shapes of simple organic molecules (hybridization).",
        "Master the IUPAC system for naming organic compounds.",
        "Classify organic compounds based on their functional groups.",
        "Define and differentiate between different types of isomerism (structural and stereoisomerism).",
        "Understand the concepts of electrophiles and nucleophiles, and the movement of electrons in organic reactions (electron displacement effects).",
        "Explain the inductive effect, electromeric effect, resonance, and hyperconjugation.",
        "Describe different types of organic reactions (substitution, addition, elimination, rearrangement)."
    ],
    prerequisites: [
        "Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure.",
        "Basic understanding of chemical reactions."
    ],
    conceptOverview: "This chapter lays the groundwork for all of organic chemistry. It introduces the unique properties of carbon that allow it to form a vast array of compounds. We will learn the systematic language of organic chemistry—the IUPAC nomenclature—which allows us to name any organic compound unambiguously. The chapter then delves into the electronic effects that govern the reactivity of organic molecules, such as the inductive effect and resonance. Understanding these principles is crucial for predicting how and why organic reactions occur. Finally, we classify the main types of organic reactions, setting the stage for studying specific functional groups in subsequent chapters.",
    tamilConnection: "கரிம வேதியியல் என்பது கார்பனின் உலகம். நாம் உண்ணும் உணவு முதல், அணியும் உடை வரை அனைத்தும் கரிமச் சேர்மங்களால் ஆனவை. இந்த அத்தியாயம், இந்த பரந்த உலகத்திற்கான ஒரு வரைபடத்தையும், அதன் மொழியையும் (பெயரிடுதல்) நமக்கு அளிக்கிறது.",
    culturalContext: "The different aromas of spices used in Tamil cuisine, like cloves (eugenol), cardamom (eucalyptol), and cinnamon (cinnamaldehyde), are due to different organic molecules with specific functional groups. The IUPAC nomenclature system, learned in this chapter, provides a universal way to name these complex structures, allowing scientists worldwide to communicate precisely about them.",
