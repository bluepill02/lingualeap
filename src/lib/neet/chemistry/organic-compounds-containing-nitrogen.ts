    learningObjectives: [
        "Classify amines as primary, secondary, and tertiary.",
        "Understand the IUPAC nomenclature of amines.",
        "Describe the methods of preparation of amines.",
        "Analyze the basic character of amines and compare the basicity of different types of amines.",
        "Explain the key chemical reactions of amines, including acylation, carbylamine reaction, and reaction with nitrous acid.",
        "Understand the preparation, properties, and reactions of diazonium salts.",
        "Describe the importance of diazonium salts in the synthesis of other aromatic compounds."

    prerequisites: [
        "Basic principles of organic chemistry.",
        "Understanding of acids and bases, and the concept of basicity."
    ],
    conceptOverview: "This chapter focuses on organic compounds containing nitrogen, primarily amines. Amines are organic derivatives of ammonia and are fundamentally basic in nature. We will explore their structure, classification, and methods of preparation. A key part of the chapter is analyzing their chemical reactivity, with a special focus on their basicity and how it's influenced by their structure. The chapter also covers diazonium salts, which are extremely versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, allowing for the preparation of a wide variety of substituted aromatic compounds from a single starting material (aniline).",
    tamilConnection: "புரதங்கள் மற்றும் நியூக்ளிக் அமிலங்கள் போன்ற உயிர் மூலக்கூறுகளின் முக்கிய கூறு நைட்ரஜன் ஆகும். அமீன்கள், அதன் காரப் பண்புகளால், பல உயிர்வேதியியல் வினைகளில் முக்கிய பங்கு வகிக்கின்றன. இந்த அத்தியாயம், இந்த முக்கிய நைட்ரஜன் சேர்மங்களின் வேதியியலை விளக்குகிறது.",
    culturalContext: "Many of the dyes used in the textile industry in places like Tiruppur are azo dyes. These vibrant dyes are synthesized using diazonium salts, a key topic in this chapter. The Sandmeyer and Gattermann reactions, which use diazonium salts, are industrially important processes for creating these colorful compounds.",

            notes: "A very important chapter. The basicity of amines (comparing primary, secondary, tertiary, and aniline) is a favorite conceptual question. Reactions of diazonium salts (Sandmeyer, Gattermann, coupling reactions) are also frequently tested.",
