    subject: 'Chemistry',
    learningObjectives: [
        "Describe the preparation, properties, and reactions of alcohols and phenols, focusing on their acidic nature.",
        "Understand the preparation and reactions of ethers.",
        "Analyze the chemistry of the carbonyl group in aldehydes and ketones.",
        "Explain key reactions of aldehydes and ketones, such as nucleophilic addition, oxidation, reduction, and condensation (e.g., Aldol, Cannizzaro).",
        "Describe the preparation, properties, and reactions of carboxylic acids, focusing on their acidic strength.",
        "Understand the reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives (esters, acid chlorides)."
    ],
    prerequisites: [
        "Hydrocarbons and Haloalkanes/Haloarenes.",
        "Understanding of reaction mechanisms like nucleophilic addition and substitution."
    ],
    conceptOverview: "This extensive topic covers the most important classes of oxygen-containing organic compounds: alcohols, phenols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. Each class has a characteristic functional group that dictates its chemical behavior. We will explore the structure, nomenclature, preparation, and key reactions for each class. A central theme is the chemistry of the carbonyl group (C=O) found in aldehydes and ketones, which undergoes characteristic nucleophilic addition reactions. The acidic nature of phenols and carboxylic acids is another crucial concept. This chapter is rich with important name reactions that are fundamental to organic synthesis.",
    tamilConnection: "கரும்புச் சாற்றிலிருந்து சர்க்கரை தயாரிப்பதில் ஆல்கஹால் ஒரு இடைநிலை சேர்மமாக உருவாகிறது. நாம் பயன்படுத்தும் வினிகர் (acetic acid) ஒரு கார்பாக்சிலிக் அமிலம். இந்த அத்தியாயம், நம் அன்றாட வாழ்வில் உள்ள பல பொருட்களின் வேதியியலை ஆழமாகப் புரிந்துகொள்ள உதவுகிறது.",
    culturalContext: "The distinct fragrance of jasmine flowers ('Madurai Malli') is due to a complex mixture of organic compounds, including benzyl acetate (an ester) and benzyl alcohol. Similarly, the aroma of cinnamon ('lavanga pattai') is from cinnamaldehyde. This chapter explores the chemistry of the functional groups (alcohols, aldehydes, esters) that give these culturally significant plants their characteristic scents.",

Name reactions (Aldol, Cannizzaro, Reimer-Tiemann, Kolbe's) and tests to distinguish between different functional groups are very important. Acidity/basicity order questions are also frequently asked.",
