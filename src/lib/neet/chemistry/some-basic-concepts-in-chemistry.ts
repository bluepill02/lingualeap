# 4. Concept Overview
Just like a master chef in a Madurai (மதுரை) restaurant needs a precise recipe to make the perfect biryani, chemists need precise rules to understand how substances combine. This chapter, **Some Basic Concepts in Chemistry**, is the 'recipe book' for all of chemistry. We will learn about the fundamental 'ingredients' (atoms and molecules) and the 'measurements' (mole concept - மோல் கருத்து) that chemists use. Understanding these basics, like stoichiometry and limiting reagents, is crucial for predicting the outcome of any chemical reaction, from a simple lab experiment to complex industrial processes.

# 5. Detailed Explanation
This unit corresponds to the **Tamil Nadu State Board Class 11 Chemistry Volume 1, Chapter 1**. It forms the foundation for all numerical problems in physical chemistry. NEET questions from this chapter are direct and formula-based.

### 5.1 Laws of Chemical Combination (வேதிச் சேர்க்கை விதிகள்)
*   **Law of Conservation of Mass:** Mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.
*   **Law of Definite Proportions:** A compound always contains the same elements in the same proportion by mass.
*   **Law of Multiple Proportions:** If two elements form more than one compound, the mass ratios of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers.
*   **Gay Lussac's Law of Gaseous Volumes & Avogadro's Law:** Deal with volume relationships in gaseous reactions.

### 5.2 Atomic and Molecular Masses
*   **Atomic Mass (அணு நிறை):** Mass of an atom, based on the C-12 scale.
*   **Molecular Mass (மூலக்கூறு நிறை):** Sum of atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule.

### 5.3 Mole Concept and Stoichiometry (மோல் கருத்து மற்றும் வினைக்கூறு விகிதம்)
*   **Mole Concept:** Defines a mole as containing **Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10²³)** of particles. One mole of any substance is equal to its molar mass in grams.
*   **Molar Mass:** The mass of one mole of a substance.
*   **Percentage Composition, Empirical and Molecular Formulae:**
    *   **Empirical Formula (எளிய விகித வாய்ப்பாடு):** The simplest whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound.
    *   **Molecular Formula (மூலக்கூறு வாய்ப்பாடு):** The actual number of atoms in a molecule. \\( Molecular Formula = n \\times Empirical Formula \\)
*   **Stoichiometry and Stoichiometric Calculations:** Calculations based on balanced chemical equations.
*   **Limiting Reagent (வரையறுக்கும் காரணி):** The reactant that is completely consumed in a reaction and limits the amount of product formed.

# 6. Worked Examples

**1. Easy:** Calculate the mass of CO₂ that could be obtained by heating 20 g of pure limestone (CaCO₃).
*   **Solution:**
    *   The reaction is \\(CaCO_3(s) \\rightarrow CaO(s) + CO_2(g)\\).
    *   Molar mass of CaCO₃ = 100 g/mol. Molar mass of CO₂ = 44 g/mol.
    *   According to the equation, 100 g of CaCO₃ produces 44 g of CO₂.
    *   Therefore, 20 g of CaCO₃ will produce \\((\\frac{44}{100}) \\times 20 = 8.8 \\text{ g}\\) of CO₂.

**2. Medium:** 50 kg of N₂(g) and 10 kg of H₂(g) are mixed to produce NH₃(g). Identify the limiting reagent.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  The balanced equation is \\(N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \\rightarrow 2NH_3(g)\\).
    2.  Moles of N₂ = 50000 g / 28 g/mol ≈ 1786 mol.
    3.  Moles of H₂ = 10000 g / 2 g/mol = 5000 mol.
    4.  From stoichiometry, 1 mole of N₂ requires 3 moles of H₂.
    5.  So, 1786 moles of N₂ would require \\(1786 \\times 3 = 5358\\) moles of H₂.
    6.  However, we only have 5000 moles of H₂. Therefore, **H₂ is the limiting reagent**.

**3. Must-Practice:** An organic compound contains 49.3% carbon, 6.84% hydrogen, and the rest is oxygen. Its molar mass is 146 g/mol. Find its empirical and molecular formulas.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  % Oxygen = 100 - (49.3 + 6.84) = 43.86%.
    2.  Calculate moles: C = 49.3/12 = 4.1, H = 6.84/1 = 6.84, O = 43.86/16 = 2.74.
    3.  Divide by smallest (2.74): C = 1.5, H = 2.5, O = 1.
    4.  Convert to whole numbers (multiply by 2): C = 3, H = 5, O = 2. **Empirical Formula is C₃H₅O₂**.
    5.  Empirical Formula Mass = 3(12) + 5(1) + 2(16) = 73 g/mol.
    6.  n = Molar Mass / Empirical Mass = 146 / 73 = 2.
    7.  **Molecular Formula = 2 × (C₃H₅O₂) = C₆H₁₀O₄**.

        problem: "Calculate the molarity of a solution of ethanol in water in which the mole fraction of ethanol is 0.040. (Assume the density of water is 1 g/mL).",
        solution: "Let nₑ be moles of ethanol and nₙ be moles of water. Mole fraction of ethanol, xₑ = nₑ / (nₑ + nₙ) = 0.040. This means nₑ = 0.040 and (nₑ + nₙ) = 1 (assuming 1 mole total for ratio). So, nₙ = 1 - 0.040 = 0.96 mol. Mass of water = 0.96 mol * 18 g/mol = 17.28 g. Volume of water (solution, since solute is small) ≈ 17.28 mL = 0.01728 L. Molarity = Moles of ethanol / Volume of solution in L = 0.040 mol / 0.01728 L ≈ 2.31 M."
